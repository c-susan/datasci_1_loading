Similarly differences in primary cancer treatment and appropriate adjuvant therapy have been shown to exist between White and minority populations (AHRQ, 2004). Although the ability to pay is one of the explanatory factors, similar disparities have been found among Medicare beneficiaries. To address this problem, Congress mandated that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conduct demonstrations aimed at reducing disparities in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer among racial and ethnic minority Medicare-insured beneficiaries (Section 122 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP [State Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program] Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000).","Keywords":"Evaluation of the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Demonstration for Ethnic and Racial Minorities, Report To Congress, RTC, cancer, minority populations, Section 122, Medicare, report","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"","Related Content 2":"","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"","At-A-Glance Reports":"","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"13"},{"Title":"Beneficiary Alignment Guidance for Medicare Fee For Service Models (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"http:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/x\/external_guidance.pdf","Month of Publication":"July","Year of publication":"2012","Abstract":"Because multiple new initiatives involving shared savings may be operating within a State implementing a managed fee-for-service (MFFS) Financial Alignment Demonstration, the Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services (CMS) is providing this guidance on how beneficiaries will be aligned with different models for purposes of calculating shared savings.

The demonstration required that incentive payments be based on net internal savings.  Both demonstration sites were within the budget neutrality limits specified for the demonstration, both realized internal hospital savings from activities implemented during the Gainsharing Demonstration, and distributed bonus payments to physicians participating in the demonstration. CMS found that Medicare cost per episode did not increase for either BIMC or CAMC and found no statistically significant reductions in quality of care or patient satisfaction.

This ongoing, randomized study of care coordination addresses the question of whether individual care coordination reduces expenditures and service utilization for Medicare by evaluating the impacts of the coordination intervention for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. Of the 15 programs originally selected for the demonstration in 2002, only two programs (Mercy Medical Center and Health Quality Partners) remained in 2008 and are discussed in the Fifth Report to Congress. The first of these programs, Mercy Medical Center, had favorable hospitalization results but increased total expenditures to Medicare. Thus, when CMS extended the program in 2008 it reduced the program fee, and by 2010 Mercy withdrew from the demonstration. In October 2010, CMS extended the sole remaining program, Health Quality Partners (HQP), for a subset of the original study population who was at greater risk of hospitalization. Over 10 years of operations (2002  -  2012), HQP reduced hospitalizations and Medicare expenditures by an amount sufficient to offset fully the HQP program fees. The greatest savings were seen among the patients in the pre-defined high-risk subgroup. However, we could not conclude with certainty that the program generated net savings to Medicare. In contrast to the earlier findings, HQP did not measurably affect hospitalizations or Medicare expenditures during the first 21 months following the October 2010 extension.","Keywords":"Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration, Report To Congress, RTC, Medicare, care coordination","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration (http:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/initiatives\/Medicare-Coordinated-Care\/)","Related Content 2":"Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration Evaluation - Health Quality Partners (PDF)  | (http:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/MedicareCoordinatedCareDemoHQP.pdf)","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"","At-A-Glance Reports":"","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"33"},{"Title":"CMS Innovation Center  -  Report to Congress (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"http:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/RTC-12-2014.pdf","Month of Publication":"December","Year of publication":"2014","Abstract":"The Affordable Care Act requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services submit to Congress a report on the CMS Innovation Centers activities at least once every other year beginning in 2012.

Between 2002 and 2010, high-risk beneficiaries enrolled in the HQP program had significantly lower hospitalizations and Medicare expenditures than control group beneficiaries.  However, after the HQP program was extended in 2010, the program had no measurable impact on hospitalizations, outpatient emergency department visits, or Medicare expenditures.  After factoring in program management fees, the program increased total Medicare expenditures by an estimated 16 percent.  The Final Evaluation tested various hypotheses to explain the decline in impacts after the extension, and found that the most likely explanation for the observed decline in impact between the two periods is that improvements in usual care for the control group decreased the added value of HQPs services for reducing hospitalizations and expenditures.  After accounting for changes in the high-risk patient population over time, HQPs impact on hospitalizations (relative to the control group) disappeared because outcomes for the control group were better for the later cohort than the pre-extension cohort, whereas outcomes for the treatment group were unchanged.","Keywords":"Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration Final Evaluation Report: Health Quality Partners\u0027 Program, Medicare, high-risk beneficiaries, high-risk populations, Fee-For-Service, FFS","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/initiatives\/Medicare-Coordinated-Care\/)","Related Content 2":"","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"","At-A-Glance Reports":"","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"65"},{"Title":"Evaluation of the Financial Alignment Initiative for Medicare-Medicaid Enrollees - Washington Preliminary Evaluation Report (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/fai-wa-prelimppone.pdf","Month of Publication":"January","Year of publication":"2016","Abstract":"The Washington demonstration leverages Medicaid health homes to test new mechanisms to integrate financing and services for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees, and allows the State and the Federal governments to share in savings resulting from quality improvements.

Overall, we found little to no evidence of MEPD effects on: inpatient admissions to IMDs or general hospital scatter beds; IMD or scatter bed lengths of stays; ER visits and ED boarding; discharge planning by participating IMDs; or the Medicaid share of IMD admissions of adults with psychiatric EMCs. Federal costs for IMD admissions increased, as expected, but changes in costs to states, IMDs, and other payers varied by state.

Under this demonstration, Medicare participated with Medicaid and private payers in eight state-led, patient-centered medical home initiatives, providing support to primary care practices and other entities (e.g., community health teams) through monthly care management fees and data feedback. This report contains the final evaluation findings on impacts of the demonstration and how implementation affected outcomes. Overall, Medicare and Medicaid outcomes were mixed and inconsistent across states, with half of the states achieving cost savings, overall positive impacts on readmission rates and medical specialist visits, and overall negative impacts on emergency department rates, admission rates, and primary care visit rates. Because it was not conducted under 3021 authority, the demonstration ended on December 2016 and was not scaled. However, these results have informed other Innovation Center models, including the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative and CPC Plus, and will be used to inform future alternate payment models. For example, CPC and CPC+ emphasized positive features of the MAPCP Demonstration and state PCMH initiatives, including the importance of having a convener and multiple payers involved as well as the value of data feedback tools and learning systems to practices. They also incorporated lessons learned, including the importance of using a stepwise approach to practice transformation.","Keywords":"Multi-Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice (MAPCP) Demonstration, Medicare, Medicaid, primary care, Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative (CPCI), Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+)","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"Multi-Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/initiatives\/Multi-Payer-Advanced-Primary-Care-Practice\/)","Related Content 2":"Multi-Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice - Final Evaluation Report Appendices (PDF)  | (https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/mapcp-finalevalrpt-appendix.pdf)","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"","At-A-Glance Reports":"","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"120"},{"Title":"FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration - Final Evaluation Report (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/fqhc-finalevalrpt.pdf","Month of Publication":"June","Year of publication":"2017","Abstract":"In November 2011, CMS launched a three-year demonstration to support federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) with delivery of advanced primary care (APC) to Medicare beneficiaries. Under this demonstration, FQHCs were expected to achieve Level 3 recognition as a patient-centered medical home from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) by the end of the demonstration. This Final Evaluation Report includes quantitative findings through the end of the demonstration on October 31, 2014 and qualitative findings from focus groups, site visits and interviews. At the end of the demonstration, 70% of demonstration FQHCs achieved National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) PCMH Level 3 recognition while only 11% of comparison FQHCs had achieved the same level of recognition. More than half of those that achieved NCQA PCMH Level 3 recognition did so in the last quarter of the demonstration.  Over the course of the demonstration the results show an increase in primary care and FQHC visits. Contrary to expectations, the demonstration showed an increase in total Medicare expenditures, emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions. These findings are likely driven by demonstration FQHCs doing a better job connecting beneficiaries to specialists and securing home care and skilled nursing care services. While this demonstration was not scaled the learnings from the FQHC APCP Demonstration have been used to inform other primary care models, such as CPC+.  For example, one of the biggest lessons learned was the importance of a multi-payer approach in designing and implementing our CMMI models.  Additionally, CMMI has become more inclusive of other approaches to medical home recognition, not focusing on NCQA PCMH recognition.","Keywords":"FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration, Federally Qualified Health Center, primary care, Medicare, Medicaid, patient-centered medical home, PCMH, care coordination, care management","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"Final Evaluation Report Appendix I-N (PDF)  |  (https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/fqhc-finalevalrpt-appi-n.pdf)","Related Content 2":"Final Evaluation Report Appendix B-H (PDF)  | (https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/fqhc-finalevalrpt-appb-h.pdf)","Related Content 3":"Final Evaluation Report Appendix A (PDF)  | (https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/fqhc-finalevalrpt-app-a.pdf)","Related Content 4":"FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration  | (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/initiatives\/FQHCs\/)","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"","At-A-Glance Reports":"","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"121"},{"Title":"Financial Alignment Initiative for Medicare-Medicaid Enrollees - Final Year 1 and Preliminary Year 2 Savings Report (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/fai-wa-finalyr1prelimyr2.pdf","Month of Publication":"July","Year of publication":"2017","Abstract":"The Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services (CMS) is releasing an actuarial savings report for the Washington Health Home Demonstration under the Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare-Medicaid Financial Alignment Initiative.

Beneficiaries who received CCM services had experienced a lower growth rate in health care expenditures, compared to those who did not receive CCM services. The decreased rate of growth was driven by decreases in expenditures for inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, and outpatient services; the decreased expenditures were partially offset by increased expenditures of home health and professional services.","Keywords":"Evaluation of the Diffusion and Impact of the Chronic Care Management (CCM) Services - Final Report, primary care, Medicare, fee-for-service (FFS), care coordination","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"","Related Content 2":"","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"","At-A-Glance Reports":"","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"144"},{"Title":"Oncology Care Model - First Annual Report: Baseline Period (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/ocm-baselinereport.pdf","Month of Publication":"February","Year of publication":"2018","Abstract":"This report focuses on the timeframe prior to the launch of the model in July 2016, with the goal of providing information on the foundational elements and design of the evaluation including the creation of a comparison group.

While some of the CVD risk among the target population is due to nonmodifiable factors (such as age and diabetes), there is still substantial room for improvement.","Keywords":"Million Hearts: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Model, Million Hearts, cardiovascular health, CVD, cardiovascular disease","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"Million Hearts: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Model (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/initiatives\/Million-Hearts-CVDRRM\/)","Related Content 2":"Findings At-A-Glance Report (PDF)  | (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/mhcvdrrm-firstannevalrpt-fg.pdf)","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"Findings At-A-Glance Report (PDF) (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/mhcvdrrm-firstannevalrpt-fg.pdf)","At-A-Glance Reports":"TRUE","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"182"},{"Title":"State Innovation Models Initiative: Model Test Awards Round Two Third Annual Report (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/sim-rd2-test-ar3.pdf","Month of Publication":"March","Year of publication":"2019","Abstract":"The Third Annual Report for the State Innovation Models (SIM) Round Two Model Test States qualitatively examines implementation efforts (through March, 2018) for the eleven Test States: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Washington.","Keywords":"State Innovation Models Initiative: Model Test Awards Round Two Third Annual Report, State Innovation Models Initiative: Model Test Awards Round Two, SIM, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"State Innovation Models Initiative: Model Test Awards Round Two (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/initiatives\/State-Innovations-Model-Testing-Round-Two\/)","Related Content 2":"Findings-At-A-Glance Report (PDF)  | (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/sim-rd2-test-ar3-fg.pdf)","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"Findings-At-A-Glance Report (PDF) (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/Files\/reports\/sim-rd2-test-ar3-fg.pdf)","At-A-Glance Reports":"TRUE","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"183"},{"Title":"Initiative to Reduce Avoidable Hospitalizations Among Nursing Facility Residents: Phase Two - Second Annual Report (PDF)","Author":"","URL":"https:\/\/downloads.cms.gov\/files\/cmmi\/rahnfr-phasetwo-secondannrpt.pdf","Month of Publication":"March","Year of publication":"2019","Abstract":"The Initiative to Reduce Avoidable Hospitalization among Nursing Facility Residents (NFI) Payment Reform was designed to reduce avoidable hospitalization among long-stay nursing facility residents by introducing a new payment model that reimburses nursing facilities and practitioners for providing higher-level care on site for six qualifying conditions.

Hospitals and PGPs participating in the BPCI Advanced Model reduced Medicare fee-for-service payments primarily by reducing post-acute care use. For surgical episodes overall, BPCI Advanced achieved net savings to Medicare and possibly improved quality of care, driven mostly by orthopedic procedures.

Spending reductions appear to be driven largely by declines in acute care utilization, particularly for Vermont Medicare beneficiaries statewide. Similar to previous years, we continue to see sharp declines in specialist E\u0026M visits, potentially due to ongoing specialist shortages in the state. There is agreement across stakeholders that the model has provided an organizing framework for collaboration, but there continues to be a lack of understanding and consistent expectations around the ACOs role and hesitancy to engage in the Medicare ACO initiative by CAHs.","Keywords":"Vermont All-Payer ACO Model (VTAPM) - Third Evaluation Report, Vermont All-Payer ACO Model (VTAPM), Medicare, accountable care organization, ACO, Medicaid","Type":"Reports","Related Content":"Findings-At-A-Glance (PDF)  |  (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/data-and-reports\/2023\/vtapm-3rd-eval-report-aag)","Related Content 2":"Appendix (PDF)  |  (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/data-and-reports\/2023\/vtapm-3rd-eval-report-app)","Related Content 3":"","Related Content 4":"","Related Content 5":"Vermont All-Payer ACO Model (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/innovation-models\/vermont-all-payer-aco-model)","At-A-Glance Reports URL":"Findings-At-A-Glance (PDF) (https:\/\/innovation.cms.gov\/data-and-reports\/2023\/vtapm-3rd-eval-report-aag)","At-A-Glance Reports":"TRUE","Perspective Report URL":"","Perspective Report":"","ID":"312"}]
